Pratt Parsers
=============

This directory contains simple parsers based on the ideas of Vaughan Pratt's
paper `Top down operator precedence <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512931>`_, as described by
Douglas Crockford's `eponymous post <http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html>`_ and Fredrik Lundh's
`Simple Top-Down Parsing in Python <http://effbot.org/zone/simple-top-down-parsing.htm>`_.

The supported syntaxes are subsets of the Python syntax, with different keywords.
